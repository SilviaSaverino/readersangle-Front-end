# Readers's angle:

'Reader's angle' website project had been created as a final portfolio project for Code Institute full stack course.

For the frontend part of the project, I chose to use React to develop a dynamic and engaging user interface. My goal was to provide readers with a seamless and intuitive experience that allows them to explore, engage, and connect with the vibrant literary community.

Using React, I crafted various components that work together harmoniously to create an interactive and visually appealing interface. I wanted readers to feel immersed in the world of books and easily connect with other book enthusiasts. By utilizing React's capabilities, I aimed to deliver a user-friendly interface that makes it effortless for readers to navigate, discover new books, and engage with the content.

It was important to me to provide a user experience that feels smooth, natural, and enjoyable, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the website and connect with fellow book lovers.

## Project Goals:

- Provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for readers to share their thoughts, opinions, and recommendations on books.

- Create a vibrant literary community where users can engage with each other's posts, fostering discussions and interactions around various books.

- Implement comprehensive CRUD functionality to allow users complete control over their interactions, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting their posts.

- Enable users to leave detailed reviews for specific books, offering valuable feedback and insights to other readers.

- Facilitate a personalized and meaningful reading experience by allowing users to express their liking for posts.

- Incorporate social features, such as the ability to like/unlike posts and reviews, to encourage engagement and interaction among users.

- Allow users to explore other users' profiles to discover their book recommendations and connect with like-minded readers.

- Lay a solid foundation for future development, enabling the addition of new features and enhancements to further enhance the reading and community experience on the website. Such as
  - 1. let users indicate their reading intentions (whether they have read a book or plan to read it).
  - 2. let users follow/unfollow a post so to stay engaged with the post discussion.
